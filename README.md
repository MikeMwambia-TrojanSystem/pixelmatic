https://jsfiddle.net/mikemwambia/wy1gs9m2/1/

What the Code does : - 

When you click on a cell all the values in the cells in the same row and column are increased by 1
if a cell was empty it gets a value of 1

After each change the cell will briefly turn yellow

If 5 consecutive numbers in the Fibonacci sequence are next to each other, these cells
will briefly turn green and will be cleared

The application will automatically check all rows and columns if they have fibanaci sequence change the colour to green then update the rows and columns with +1

To see it in action navigate to the folder and open the grid.html file in a browser it will initialize a table grid with populated numbers click on any other row and observe how the row with 0 behave since this row is a fibonaci sequence number.
